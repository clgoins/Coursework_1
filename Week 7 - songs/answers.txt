If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?:
I'd possibly call it Purple and Yellow. It seems like the danceability value is fairly high, while the energy and valence values are much more neutral.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?:
A raw average of the values provided could be skewed one way or another if the listener has, for example, a bad week, where maybe they were listening to music with
a much lower danceabiliy & valence rating than what would otherwise be normal. I suppose one could analyze the data in order to find trends like this in order to discard
statistical outliers. This could maybe result in a list that reflects a more "average" listening experience for the listener in question.
