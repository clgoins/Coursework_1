# CS50 Coursework

This repo is a collection of my course work performed for Harvard's online CS50 course.
Each folder is a different assignment, containing the source code for the assignment,
along with a text file with the instructions for the assignment.

The course began with simple CLI applications written in C, and later moved on to small projects
using several other technologies, including SQL, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Python, and a few small web applications
using Python with the Flask framework.
