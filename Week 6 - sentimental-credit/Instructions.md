## Instructions

In a filed called credit.py in a folder called sentimental-credit, write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via print) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1. Your program this time should be written in Python!
